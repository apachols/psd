<p>Log in using with the ID and password we sent after you registered--the ID should be something like "AB123X".    <b>User names are case sensitive (and usually uppercase)!</b></p>


<form method="post" action="{% url django.contrib.auth.views.login %}">
{% csrf_token %}

<tr>
    <td>{{ form.username.label_tag }}</td>
    <td>{{ form.username }}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>{{ form.password.label_tag }}</td>
    <td>{{ form.password }}</td>
</tr>
</table>

<input type="submit" value="login" />
<input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ next }}" />
</form>

<p>
If you have forgotten your ID or your password, you can reset your password
by going to the <a href="{% url password-reset %}">Password Reset Page</a> and
handing over your email address.  The system will then email you your username
and a link to reset your password.

<p>

PLEASE do this rather than making a new registration or emailing the staff if
at all possible.  The former will mean you will possibly get dates with people
you have seen before, the latter will negatively impact an already overworked
technical support division.
