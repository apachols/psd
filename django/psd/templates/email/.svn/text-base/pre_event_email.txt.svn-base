Dear {{ rr.nickname }} ({{rr.psdid}}),

We look forward to seeing you at Poly Speed Dating! Here are some reminders and
some final information about the event.

The event is on {{ event.date|date:"l, F d" }} at {{ event.location }}.
Remember that you absolutely need to be there by {{event.deadlinetime|time:"f a"}}; 
check-in and pre-event socializing starts at {{event.starttime|time:"f a"}}.

We'll have free food and soft drinks for you as part of the event. You can also
buy beer and cocktails and many other things from the bar (with appropriate
ID). The food, by the way, will include vegetarian and gluten-free options. And
since this is The Friendly Toast, we basically assume it will all taste amazing.

{% if not rr.paid %}Now, according to our records, you haven't paid! If that's
true, you have two choices: <a
href="http://boston.polyspeeddating.com/Register.html">Pay now through
Paypal (go directly to Step 2)</a> or pay the walk-in rate ($15 per person) in
cash at the event. The online discount will end 24 hours before Poly Speed
Dating starts.

If, on the contrary, you actually have paid: oops! Send us an email at
{{ event.info_email|default:"info@polyspeeddating.com" }} that includes your Poly
Speed Dating ID and the details of the Paypal transaction (or however you
paid), and we'll sort things out.{% endif %}

Next, here is an automated summary of your registration: {{ rr.geekcode }}

If anything in that summary is wrong or has changed,
log in to http://www.polyspeeddating.com{% url django.contrib.auth.views.login %} 
with the username and password that came in your original registration email, and
you can edit your information. If you have any trouble, email us at 
{{ event.info_email|default:"info@polyspeeddating.com" }} and let us know! 

Finally, we want to promise you that if you come to the event and have fewer than
four dates-- because of demographics, cancellations, cosmic rays, whatever-- then your
evening is on us; talk to us as the event ends and we'll get you a refund.

The key details again:

* Venue: {{event.location}}, at {{event.address}}
* Venue URL: {{event.locationURL}}
* The evening goes from {{event.starttime|time:"f"}} to {{event.stoptime|time:"f a"}}.
* Check-in starts at {{ event.starttime|time:"f a" }}  You _must_ be there by {{ event.deadlinetime|time:"f a" }}

See you soon!

- Aaron, Rowan and Rosa
