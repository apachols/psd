<h1>NOTE:<br> Registration for Some Demographic Categories is Now Full.<br>  Some restrictions are in place.</h1>
<h2 align="center">Please read</h2>

Due to an imbalance in registration demographics, we are having to cut
off registration for solo men who are only looking for women and/or trans women, unless
they bring a woman friend of any sexual persuasion  (who dates separately and is not
necessarily the man's partner).  This maintains the ratio of men seeking women to women, generally.  We are sorry to have to do this, but it
is in the interest of making sure everyone who registered so far gets
a full complement of dates.  Registering as a group is still okay.  We
will try to have another event, assuming this one goes well!
<p>
We have to do this so that there are enough dates to go around for
those who have registered.  Furthermore, it is important that those
who register as looking for multiple genders get to go on dates with the full range of people that they are interested in.  This means that even a slight imbalance leads to problems
with matching since the majority of woman who register seem to be looking for other
genders in addition to men.
<p>
Please note that transgender men are not affected by this policy at this time.
<p>
If you want to attend, and are affected by this policy, then follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Find a woman friend.  Our apologies, but friends who have already
registered do not count.
</li>
<li> 
Have your friend register, and have her list you as a reference and give you
her registration ID.
</li>
<li>
Register yourself.  Cite your friend in the "remarks" field so we
don't have you date someone you already know.  Include her registration ID.  We will then honor your registration.
</li>

<li>Potentially collect free beverage or gift at the event for having
someone cite you as a reference!</li>
</ol>

<p>


Again, sorry for the restriction.
<p>

<h3>Continue to registration....</h3>
<ul>
<p>Registration options (click on the one for you):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><a href="http://www.polyspeeddating.com/reg/individual/">Individual</a> - you may or may not have relationships 
    at the moment, but you want to look for more of them right now</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.polyspeeddating.com/reg/group/">Group</a> - You all are an existing relationship, and are looking for someone(s) together.</p>
</blockquote>

</ul>



Note that even a gay woman friend helps a lot since such a high proportion of our women daters are either gay or bi (usually 75%).  For that matter, a gay man friend would count too.
