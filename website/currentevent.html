/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.

The Revival sources their ingredients locally, makes their own charcuterie, and crafts all their food (including vegan and vegetarian options) with care.

<!--<h2 align="center">Queer Poly Speed Dating at the LGBT Center</h2>
    <h2 align="center">Thursday, December 1st, LGBT Center in San Francisco</h2>

	<p>
For this event, we are asking that people only attend if they identify as queer or LGBT.  (And don't forget that the B is for bisexual--bi and pan folks are welcome!)  Queer people don't necessarily get to often be in all-queer social spaces, and we are hoping that a queer event vibe will be something new and fun, bring more folks out of the woodwork, and lead to excellent dating connections.
<p>


<h3>Event Details</h3>
<ul>

at the <a href="http://www.sfcenter.org/">LGBT Center</a>

<br>  Many MUNI metro lines, the F streetcar, and many bus lines all run within 1 block of the Center. Also, you can take BART to SF Civic Center, then transfer to Muni Metro or F lines.
<br>  Food will be provided (including vegetarian and vegan options).
<br>  This is a 18+ event.
<br>  Pre-registration price: $12.00 per person, mainly to cover food and space costs.
<br>  Door price: $20.00.
<br>  No person turned away for lack of funds--please contact us!

<p>Check-in starts at 6p.m.

    <h2 align="center">BIG CHANGES, BIG EXPERIMENTS</h2>
    <blockquote>We have reworked the entire PSD system to make it better, faster, sexier. In particular, we made made the registration system such that it is truely possible to track dating history and not have people date past dates in future events. We are now making it so it is easier to add new questions and matching criteria, which will allow us to have sister events such as kink-speed-dating or freak-speed-dating.
      <p>

      We are still trying out a &quot;nightclub/bar&quot; feel for a venue. We are excited by the idea of a more &quot;datey&quot; and relaxed feel for our event. You can get a pre-event drink, relax and mingle a little in the lounge, flirt and scope out potential dates, have a bite to eat, and enjoy the ambient atmosphere and music. There will be two rounds of breaks in the dating to again allow for a more relaxed experience. This experiment does come with sacrifice (childcare and under-21 people) but we still think it would be worth a try. In the future, we will try and find a restauraunt so the under-21 people can attend.  Finding childcare solutions remains problematic, unfortunately.
