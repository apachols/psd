<h1 align="center">Notes on Who Came and What They Wanted</h1>


The last event had 105 people, 26 of which were dating as groups.  There were 49 women and trans women, 52 men and trans men, and 4 who identified as having either both or neither gender.

<p>
The overall situation is that most people had a pool of potential matches.  

<h3>Number of Dates</h3>

There were 14 dating rounds at the event.  Most people had a good number of dates (not including friend dates).  Only 12 of the 92 dating "entities" (i.e., individuals or groups dating together) had fewer than 6 dates.  The following table shows the number of dating entities that had a particular number of dates.  For example, 26 entities had between 9 and 11 dates that evening.

<blockquote>
<pre>
                  Number of Dates
            0-2   3-5   6-8  9-11 12-14 
# entities    2    10    29    26    25  = 92
</pre>
</blockquote>

Note that we try to warn people if they are going to have fewer than 3 dates before they show, but due to last-minute cancellations and changes, sometimes the unavoidable happens.  Generally speaking these people do seem to have a good time regardless.  We know of more than one instance where the single date of the evening was definitely worthwhile for all parties concerned.

<h3>Gender and Gender Preference</h3>
The following shows who was looking for which genders.  For example, 24 women were looking for either men or women for their dates.
<blockquote>
<pre>
                    Looking for...
            Both        Same       Opposite
Gender     Genders   Gender Only  Gender Only
  F          24           8           17
  M          10           1           41
  both        3           0            0
  none        1           0            0
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that the above could be read as "functionally Bi," "functionally gay," and "functionally Straight."  Note that the apparent sexual preferences people state in their forms may not be their actual full preference--bi folks, for example, are allowed to look for just one gender at a PSD event if they so choose.

<p>
There were 5 trans people, and 29 people open to dating trans people.  There were 3 genderqueer people, and 36 people open to dating genderqueer people.

<h3>Age</h3>

The following table shows how many people were in the given age ranges.

<blockquote>
<pre>
                 Age Range
         15-29  30-44  45-59  60-up
# folks     21     56     25      3  = 105 people
</pre>
</blockquote>

Most people are in the 30-44 range, but there are significant numbers of folks at other ages as well.
