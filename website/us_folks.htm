When he told folks, they gotexcited.  How could he not move forward?  Luke, an ex-high-schoolteacher, is now a grad student at UC Berkeley.  At various points inhis life, he has gotten involved in various social networkingexperiments 'cause he finds them fun and cool.  He has a wife, a lover, and two kids.  Longwalks on the beach kind of wear him out.  He likes lying in the sandinstead.<p align="right"><a href="mailto:luke@polyspeeddating.com">Email Luke</a></p><p><strong>Pepper</strong><br>Pepper is a local activist in the bi, poly, gender, and you-name-itscenes.  He has been so for years.  He has been suckered into helping with this as well.  Whilehe claims to be polysaturated, he has poor impulse control.  So don'tgive up hope just yet.<p align="right"><a href="mailto:pepper@polyspeeddating.com">Email Pepper</a></p><p><strong>Jen</strong><br>Jen has taught several workshops in the bay area regarding issues ofpolyamory.  Happily, her once-again-a-student status makes it possible to lay claimon some hours of her time for help organizing this event as well.  It shouldbe noted that, possibly due to some latent gene shared withhummingbirds and other pollinators, she seems to date adisproportionate number of folks with brightly colored hair.<p align="right"><a href="mailto:jen@polyspeeddating.com">Email Jen</a></p><strong>Debby</strong><br>Debby is very excited about the entire poly speed dating concept, but not so good at speed dating herself, despite being bi and kinky.  To compensate, she is helping with the event with the secret agenda of meeting people while not on dates with them.   When not being naughty, she can often be found climbing up rock faces or seeking out unusual food items.<p align="right"><a href="mailto:debby@polyspeeddating.com">Email Debby</a></p><strong>Miranda</strong><br>Once upon a time, Miranda was a "community organizer" with bisexual groups in New York.  She's just another poly-bi-kinky Bay Area resident now.  While she simply has no time to date any new people after the last Poly Speed Dating event, she missed <del>bossing around</del> organizing, and volunteered to help out.<p align="right"><a href="mailto:miranda@polyspeeddating.com">Email Miranda</a></p><h1 align="center">Contact Us, Generally</h1>Other than <a href="mailto:info@polyspeeddating.com">email</a>, you can call us at our very own hot-line (otherwise known as Luke's cell phone): 510-735-7635.<p align="center"><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a> ~ <a href="us_folks.htm">Who We Are</a> ~ <a href="mailto:info@polyspeeddating.com">Email Us</a></p></td><td width="10%"><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br><image src="polyamory_heart.gif" width=50><br></td></tr></table></body></html>
